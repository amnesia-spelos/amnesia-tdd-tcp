# Amnesia-TDD-TCP

_A fork of Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent aiming to create a TCP communication protocol for client application to interact with or control the game_

## 🎯 Project Goals

Unlike other forks of the game, our project focuses primarily on:

- 🗃️ Language agnostic interface

_Control the game from any language, any environment, you bring your own tools._

- 🧪 Developer facing functions

_Developing a standard custom story? Don't ship with amnesia-tdd-tcp, use it to make your development life easier._

## 💻 Setting up your Development Environment

If you'd like to try building the project yourself, you can [follow the development environment setup guide](https://github.com/amnesia-spelos/amnesia-tdd-tcp/wiki/dev-env-setup), which should get you started with everything you need. 🙂 Thanks for considering helping out, it means a lot!
