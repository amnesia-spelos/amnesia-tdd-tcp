# amnesia-tdd-tcp

_A fork of Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent aiming to create a TCP communication protocol for client application to interact with or control the game_

## 🎯 Project Goals

Unlike other forks of the game, our project focuses primarily on:

- 🗃️ Language agnostic interface

_Control the game from any language, any environment, you bring your own tools._

- 🧪 Developer facing functions

_Developing a standard custom story? Don't ship with amnesia-tdd-tcp, use it to make your development life easier._
